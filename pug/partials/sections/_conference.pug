      p Every chance I get, I water the plants, Lion! You do know, you do know that they don’t want you to have lunch. I’m keeping it real with you, so what you going do is have lunch.

Watch your back, but more importantly when you get out the shower, dry your back, it’s a cold world out there. The ladies always say Khaled you smell good, I use no cologne. Cocoa butter is the key.
